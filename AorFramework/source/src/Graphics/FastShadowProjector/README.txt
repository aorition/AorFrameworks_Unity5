What is Fast Shadow Projector?
======================================================


This is a much faster, easy-to-use alternative to the Blob Shadow Projector.
If you need to render lots of blob shadows that fall correctly on any surface 
while still maintaining high framerate even on mobile devices â€“ look no further.> Shadows fall correctly on any surface> Many shadows on a mesh with one draw call> Highly customizable: opacity, shape, size, etc.> Shadows maintain objectâ€™s orientation> No quads hovering above surfaces> Great performance!
> Supports lightmaps
> Supports terrain!
